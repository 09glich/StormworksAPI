To use these simple bits of code just coppy and paste this at the top of the script

```lua
local input = require("API/Input")
local output = require("API/Output")
local property = require("API/property")
local screen = require("API/screen")
local map = require("API/map")

```

and to use it ingame just remove these requires and coppy and paste from the editor


If auto complete does not work right away make sure that you have a auto complete plugin installed. if thats not working try restarting. if all else fails contact the creator of the autocomplete then contact me
