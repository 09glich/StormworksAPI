To use these simple bits of code just coppy and paste this at the top of the script

```lua
local input = require("API/Input.lua")
local output = require("API/Output.lua")
local property = require("API/property.lua")
local screen = require("API/screen.lua")
local map = require("API/map.lua")

```

and to use it ingame just remove these requires and coppy and paste from the editor
